# Introduction

RippleAPI is the official client library to the XRP Ledger. Currently, RippleAPI is only available in JavaScript.
Using RippleAPI, you can:

* [Query transactions from the XRP Ledger history](#gettransaction)
* [Sign](#sign) transactions securely without connecting to any server
* [Submit](#submit) transactions to the XRP Ledger, including [Payments](#payment), [Orders](#order), [Settings changes](#settings), and [other types](#transaction-types)
* [Generate a new XRP Ledger Address](#generateaddress)
* ... and [much more](#api-methods).

RippleAPI only provides access to *validated*, *immutable* transaction data.

## Boilerplate

Use the following [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) to wrap your custom code using RippleAPI.

```javascript
const RippleAPI = require('ripple-lib').RippleAPI;

const api = new RippleAPI({
  server: 'wss://s1.ripple.com' // Public rippled server hosted by Ripple, Inc.
});
api.on('error', (errorCode, errorMessage) => {
  console.log(errorCode + ': ' + errorMessage);
});
api.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('connected');
});
api.on('disconnected', (code) => {
  // code - [close code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent) sent by the server
  // will be 1000 if this was normal closure
  console.log('disconnected, code:', code);
});
api.connect().then(() => {
  /* insert code here */
}).then(() => {
  return api.disconnect();
}).catch(console.error);
```

RippleAPI is designed to work in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version **6.11.3**. RippleAPI may work on older Node.js versions if you use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for [ECMAScript 6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) support.

The code samples in this documentation are written with ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features, but `RippleAPI` also works with ECMAScript 5 (ES5). Regardless of whether you use ES5 or ES6, the methods that return Promises return [ES6-style promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

<aside class="notice">
All the code snippets in this documentation assume that you have surrounded them with this boilerplate.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
If you omit the "catch" section, errors may not be visible.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
The "error" event is emitted whenever an error occurs that cannot be associated with a specific request. If the listener is not registered, an exception will be thrown whenever the event is emitted.
</aside>

### Parameters

The RippleAPI constructor optionally takes one argument, an object with the following options:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
authorization | string | *Optional* Username and password for HTTP basic authentication to the rippled server in the format **username:password**.
certificate | string | *Optional* A string containing the certificate key of the client in PEM format. (Can be an array of certificates).
feeCushion | number | *Optional* Factor to multiply estimated fee by to provide a cushion in case the required fee rises during submission of a transaction. Defaults to `1.2`.
key | string | *Optional* A string containing the private key of the client in PEM format. (Can be an array of keys).
passphrase | string | *Optional* The passphrase for the private key of the client.
proxy | uri string | *Optional* URI for HTTP/HTTPS proxy to use to connect to the rippled server.
proxyAuthorization | string | *Optional* Username and password for HTTP basic authentication to the proxy in the format **username:password**.
server | uri string | *Optional* URI for rippled websocket port to connect to. Must start with `wss://` or `ws://`.
timeout | integer | *Optional* Timeout in milliseconds before considering a request to have failed.
trace | boolean | *Optional* If true, log rippled requests and responses to stdout.
trustedCertificates | array\<string\> | *Optional* Array of PEM-formatted SSL certificates to trust when connecting to a proxy. This is useful if you want to use a self-signed certificate on the proxy server. Note: Each element must contain a single certificate; concatenated certificates are not valid.

If you omit the `server` parameter, RippleAPI operates [offline](#offline-functionality).


### Installation ###

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the Node Package Manager (npm). Most Linux distros have a package for Node.js; check that it's the version you want.
2. Use npm to install RippleAPI:
      `npm install ripple-lib`

After you have installed ripple-lib, you can create scripts using the [boilerplate](#boilerplate) and run them using the Node.js executable, typically named `node`:

      `node script.js`

## Offline functionality

RippleAPI can also function without internet connectivity. This can be useful in order to generate secrets and sign transactions from a secure, isolated machine.

To instantiate RippleAPI in offline mode, use the following boilerplate code:

```javascript
const RippleAPI = require('ripple-lib').RippleAPI;

const api = new RippleAPI();
/* insert code here */
```

Methods that depend on the state of the XRP Ledger are unavailable in offline mode. To prepare transactions offline, you **must** specify  the `fee`, `sequence`, and `maxLedgerVersion` parameters in the [transaction instructions](#transaction-instructions). You can use the following methods while offline:

* [preparePayment](#preparepayment)
* [prepareTrustline](#preparetrustline)
* [prepareOrder](#prepareorder)
* [prepareOrderCancellation](#prepareordercancellation)
* [prepareSettings](#preparesettings)
* [prepareEscrowCreation](#prepareescrowcreation)
* [prepareEscrowCancellation](#prepareescrowcancellation)
* [prepareEscrowExecution](#prepareescrowexecution)
* [sign](#sign)
* [generateAddress](#generateaddress)
* [computeLedgerHash](#computeledgerhash)

# Basic Types

## Address

```json
"r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59"
```

Every XRP Ledger account has an *address*, which is a base58-encoding of a hash of the account's public key. XRP Ledger addresses always start with the lowercase letter `r`.

## Account Sequence Number

Every XRP Ledger account has a *sequence number* that is used to keep transactions in order. Every transaction must have a sequence number. A transaction can only be executed if it has the next sequence number in order, of the account sending it. This prevents one transaction from executing twice and transactions executing out of order. The sequence number starts at `1` and increments for each transaction that the account makes.

## Currency

Currencies are represented as either 3-character currency codes or 40-character uppercase hexadecimal strings. We recommend using uppercase [ISO 4217 Currency Codes](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php) only. The string "XRP" is disallowed on trustlines because it is reserved for the XRP Ledger's native currency. The following characters are permitted: all uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, as well as the symbols `?`, `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, and `|`.

## Value
A *value* is a quantity of a currency represented as a decimal string. Be careful: JavaScript's native number format does not have sufficient precision to represent all values. XRP has different precision from other currencies.

**XRP** has 6 significant digits past the decimal point. In other words, XRP cannot be divided into positive values smaller than `0.000001` (1e-6). XRP has a maximum value of `100000000000` (1e11).

**Non-XRP values** have 16 decimal digits of precision, with a maximum value of `9999999999999999e80`. The smallest positive non-XRP value is `1e-81`.


## Amount

Example amount:

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "counterparty": "rMH4UxPrbuMa1spCBR98hLLyNJp4d8p4tM",
  "value": "100"
}
```

Example XRP amount:
```json
{
  "currency": "XRP",
  "value": "2000"
}
```

An *amount* is data structure representing a currency, a quantity of that currency, and the counterparty on the trustline that holds the value. For XRP, there is no counterparty.

A *lax amount* allows the counterparty to be omitted for all currencies. If the counterparty is not specified in an amount within a transaction specification, then any counterparty may be used for that amount.

A *lax lax amount* allows either or both the counterparty and value to be omitted.

A *balance* is an amount than can have a negative value.

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
currency | [currency](#currency) | The three-character code or hexadecimal string used to denote currencies
counterparty | [address](#address) | *Optional* The Ripple address of the account that owes or is owed the funds (omitted if `currency` is "XRP")
value | [value](#value) | *Optional* The quantity of the currency, denoted as a string to retain floating point precision

# Transaction Overview

## Transaction Types

A transaction type is specified by the strings in the first column in the table below.

Type | Description
---- | -----------
[payment](#payment) | A `payment` transaction represents a transfer of value from one account to another. Depending on the [path](https://ripple.com/build/paths/) taken, additional exchanges of value may occur atomically to facilitate the payment.
[order](#order) | An `order` transaction creates a limit order. It defines an intent to exchange currencies, and creates an order in the XRP Ledger's order book if not completely fulfilled when placed. Orders can be partially fulfilled.
[orderCancellation](#order-cancellation) | An `orderCancellation` transaction cancels an order in the XRP Ledger's order book.
[trustline](#trustline) | A `trustline` transactions creates or modifies a trust line between two accounts.
[settings](#settings) | A `settings` transaction modifies the settings of an account in the XRP Ledger.
[escrowCreation](#escrow-creation) | An `escrowCreation` transaction creates an escrow on the ledger, which locks XRP until a cryptographic condition is met or it expires. It is like an escrow service where the XRP Ledger acts as the escrow agent.
[escrowCancellation](#escrow-cancellation) | An `escrowCancellation` transaction unlocks the funds in an escrow and sends them back to the creator of the escrow, but it will only work after the escrow expires.
[escrowExecution](#escrow-execution) | An `escrowExecution` transaction unlocks the funds in an escrow and sends them to the destination of the escrow, but it will only work if the cryptographic condition is provided.

## Transaction Flow

Executing a transaction with `RippleAPI` requires the following four steps:

1. Prepare - Create an unsigned transaction based on a [specification](#transaction-specifications) and [instructions](#transaction-instructions). There is a method to prepare each type of transaction:
    * [preparePayment](#preparepayment)
    * [prepareTrustline](#preparetrustline)
    * [prepareOrder](#prepareorder)
    * [prepareOrderCancellation](#prepareordercancellation)
    * [prepareSettings](#preparesettings)
    * [prepareEscrowCreation](#prepareescrowcreation)
    * [prepareEscrowCancellation](#prepareescrowcancellation)
    * [prepareEscrowExecution](#prepareescrowexecution)
2. [Sign](#sign) - Cryptographically sign the transaction locally and save the [transaction ID](#transaction-id). Signing is how the owner of an account authorizes a transaction to take place. For multisignature transactions, the `signedTransaction` fields returned by `sign` must be collected and passed to the [combine](#combine) method.
3. [Submit](#submit) - Submit the transaction to the connected server.
4. Verify - Verify that the transaction got validated by querying with [getTransaction](#gettransaction). This is necessary because transactions may fail even if they were successfully submitted.

## Transaction Fees

Every transaction must destroy a small amount of XRP as a cost to send the transaction. This is also called a *transaction fee*. The transaction cost is designed to increase along with the load on the XRP Ledger, making it very expensive to deliberately or inadvertently overload the peer-to-peer network that powers the XRP Ledger.

You can choose the size of the fee you want to pay or let a default be used. You can get an estimate of the fee required to be included in the next ledger closing with the [getFee](#getfee) method.

## Transaction Instructions

Transaction instructions indicate how to execute a transaction, complementary with the [transaction specification](#transaction-specifications).

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
fee | [value](#value) | *Optional* An exact fee to pay for the transaction. See [Transaction Fees](#transaction-fees) for more information.
maxFee | [value](#value) | *Optional* The maximum fee to pay for the transaction. See [Transaction Fees](#transaction-fees) for more information.
maxLedgerVersion | integer,null | *Optional* The highest ledger version that the transaction can be included in. If this option and `maxLedgerVersionOffset` are both omitted, the `maxLedgerVersion` option will default to 3 greater than the current validated ledger version (equivalent to `maxLedgerVersionOffset=3`). Use `null` to not set a maximum ledger version.
maxLedgerVersionOffset | integer | *Optional* Offset from current validated legder version to highest ledger version that the transaction can be included in.
sequence | [sequence](#account-sequence-number) | *Optional* The initiating account's sequence number for this transaction.
signersCount | integer | *Optional* Number of signers that will be signing this transaction.

We recommended that you specify a `maxLedgerVersion` so that you can quickly determine that a failed transaction will never succeeed in the future. It is impossible for a transaction to succeed after the XRP Ledger's consensus-validated ledger version exceeds the transaction's `maxLedgerVersion`. If you omit `maxLedgerVersion`, the "prepare*" method automatically supplies a `maxLedgerVersion` equal to the current ledger plus 3, which it includes in the return value from the "prepare*" method.

## Transaction ID

```json
"F4AB442A6D4CBB935D66E1DA7309A5FC71C7143ED4049053EC14E3875B0CF9BF"
```

A transaction ID is a 64-bit hexadecimal string that uniquely identifies the transaction. The transaction ID is derived from the transaction instruction and specifications, using a strong hash function.

You can look up a transaction by ID using the [getTransaction](#gettransaction) method.

## Transaction Memos

Every transaction can optionally have an array of memos for user applications. The `memos` field in each [transaction specification](#transaction-specifications) is an array of objects with the following structure:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
data | string | *Optional* Arbitrary string, conventionally containing the content of the memo.
format | string | *Optional* Conventionally containing information on how the memo is encoded, for example as a [MIME type](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). Only characters allowed in URLs are permitted.
type | string | *Optional* Conventionally, a unique relation (according to [RFC 5988](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4)) that defines the format of this memo. Only characters allowed in URLs are permitted.

# Transaction Specifications

A *transaction specification* specifies what a transaction should do. Each [Transaction Type](#transaction-types) has its own type of specification.

## Payment

---- | ---- | -----------
source | object | The source of the funds to be sent.
*source.* address | [address](#address) | The address to send from.

*source.* tag | integer | *Optional* An arbitrary unsigned 32-bit integer that identifies a reason for payment or a non-Ripple account.
*source.* maxAmount | [laxAmount](#amount) | The maximum amount to send. (This field is exclusive with source.amount)
destination | object | The destination of the funds to be sent.
*destination.* address | [address](#address) | The address to receive at.
*destination.* amount | [laxAmount](#amount) | An exact amount to deliver to the recipient. If the counterparty is not specified, amounts with any counterparty may be used. (This field is exclusive with destination.minAmount).
*destination.* tag | integer | *Optional* An arbitrary unsigned 32-bit integer that identifies a reason for payment or a non-Ripple account.
*destination.* address | [address](#address) | The address to send to.
*destination.* minAmount | [laxAmount](#amount) | The minimum amount to be delivered. (This field is exclusive with destination.amount)
allowPartialPayment | boolean | *Optional* A boolean that, if set to true, indicates that this payment should go through even if the whole amount cannot be delivered because of a lack of liquidity or funds in the source account account
invoiceID | string | *Optional* A 256-bit hash that can be used to identify a particular payment.
limitQuality | boolean | *Optional* Only take paths where all the conversions have an input:output ratio that is equal or better than the ratio of destination.amount:source.maxAmount.
memos | [memos](#transaction-memos) | *Optional* Array of memos to attach to the transaction.
noDirectRipple | boolean | *Optional* A boolean that can be set to true if paths are specified and the sender would like the Ripple Network to disregard any direct paths from the source account to the destination account. This may be used to take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity or by gateways wishing to issue balances from a hot wallet to a user who has mistakenly set a trustline directly to the hot wallet
paths | string | *Optional* The paths of trustlines and orders to use in executing the payment.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description

*options.* includeTransactions | boolean | *Optional* Return an array of hashes for each transaction or an array of all transactions that were validated in this ledger version, depending on whether `includeAllData` is set.
*options.* ledgerVersion | integer | *Optional* Get ledger data for this historical ledger version.

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with an object with the following structure:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
stateHash | string | Hash of all state information in this ledger.
closeTime | date-time string | The time at which this ledger was closed.
closeTimeResolution | integer | Approximate number of seconds between closing one ledger version and closing the next one.
closeFlags | integer | A bit-map of flags relating to the closing of this ledger. Currently, the ledger has only one flag defined for `closeFlags`: **sLCF_NoConsensusTime** (value 1). If this flag is enabled, it means that validators were in conflict regarding the correct close time for the ledger, but built otherwise the same ledger, so they declared consensus while "agreeing to disagree" on the close time. In this case, the consensus ledger contains a `closeTime` value that is 1 second after that of the previous ledger. (In this case, there is no official close time, but the actual real-world close time is probably 3-6 seconds later than the specified `closeTime`.)
ledgerHash | string | Unique identifying hash of the entire ledger.
ledgerVersion | integer | The ledger version of this ledger.
parentLedgerHash | string | Unique identifying hash of the ledger that came immediately before this one.
parentCloseTime | date-time string | The time at which the previous ledger was closed.
totalDrops | [value](#value) | Total number of drops (1/1,000,000th of an XRP) in the network, as a quoted integer. (This decreases as transaction fees cause XRP to be destroyed.)
transactionHash | string | Hash of the transaction information included in this ledger.
rawState | string | *Optional* A JSON string containing all state data for this ledger in rippled JSON format.
rawTransactions | string | *Optional* A JSON string containing rippled format transaction JSON for all transactions that were validated in this ledger.
stateHashes | array\<string\> | *Optional* An array of hashes of all state data in this ledger.
transactionHashes | array\<[id](#transaction-id)\> | *Optional* An array of hashes of all transactions that were validated in this ledger.
transactions | array\<[getTransaction](#gettransaction)\> | *Optional* Array of all transactions that were validated in this ledger. Transactions are represented in the same format as the return value of [getTransaction](#gettransaction).

### Example

return api.getLedger()
  .then(ledger => {/* ... */});

## computeLedgerHash

`computeLedgerHash(ledger: Object): string`

Compute the hash of a ledger.

### Parameters

<aside class="notice">
The parameter to this method has the same structure as the return value of getLedger.
</aside>

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
ledger | object | The ledger header to hash.
*ledger.* stateHash | string | Hash of all state information in this ledger.
*ledger.* closeTime | date-time string | The time at which this ledger was closed.
*ledger.* closeTimeResolution | integer | Approximate number of seconds between closing one ledger version and closing the next one.
*ledger.* closeFlags | integer | A bit-map of flags relating to the closing of this ledger. Currently, the ledger has only one flag defined for `closeFlags`: **sLCF_NoConsensusTime** (value 1). If this flag is enabled, it means that validators were in conflict regarding the correct close time for the ledger, but built otherwise the same ledger, so they declared consensus while "agreeing to disagree" on the close time. In this case, the consensus ledger contains a `closeTime` value that is 1 second after that of the previous ledger. (In this case, there is no official close time, but the actual real-world close time is probably 3-6 seconds later than the specified `closeTime`.)
*ledger.* ledgerHash | string | Unique identifying hash of the entire ledger.
*ledger.* ledgerVersion | integer | The ledger version of this ledger.
*ledger.* parentLedgerHash | string | Unique identifying hash of the ledger that came immediately before this one.
*ledger.* parentCloseTime | date-time string | The time at which the previous ledger was closed.
*ledger.* totalDrops | [value](#value) | Total number of drops (1/1,000,000th of an XRP) in the network, as a quoted integer. (This decreases as transaction fees cause XRP to be destroyed.)
*ledger.* transactionHash | string | Hash of the transaction information included in this ledger.
*ledger.* rawState | string | *Optional* A JSON string containing all state data for this ledger in rippled JSON format.
*ledger.* rawTransactions | string | *Optional* A JSON string containing rippled format transaction JSON for all transactions that were validated in this ledger.
*ledger.* stateHashes | array\<string\> | *Optional* An array of hashes of all state data in this ledger.
*ledger.* transactionHashes | array\<[id](#transaction-id)\> | *Optional* An array of hashes of all transactions that were validated in this ledger.
*ledger.* transactions | array\<[getTransaction](#gettransaction)\> | *Optional* Array of all transactions that were validated in this ledger. Transactions are represented in the same format as the return value of [getTransaction](#gettransaction).

### Return Value

This method returns an uppercase hexadecimal string representing the hash of the ledger.

### Example

```javascript
const ledger = {
  "stateHash": "D9ABF622DA26EEEE48203085D4BC23B0F77DC6F8724AC33D975DA3CA492D2E44",

## error

This event is emitted when there is an error on the connection to the server that cannot be associated to a specific request.

### Return Value

The first parameter is a string indicating the error type:
* `badMessage` - rippled returned a malformed message
* `websocket` - the websocket library emitted an error
* one of the error codes found in the [rippled Universal Errors](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#universal-errors).

The second parameter is a message explaining the error.

The third parameter is:
* the message that caused the error for `badMessage`
* the error object emitted for `websocket`
* the parsed response for rippled errors

### Example

```javascript
api.on('error', (errorCode, errorMessage, data) => {
  console.log(errorCode + ': ' + errorMessage);
});
```

```
tooBusy: The server is too busy to help you now.
```

## connected

This event is emitted after connection successfully opened.

### Example

```javascript
api.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Connection is open now.');
});
```

## disconnected

This event is emitted when connection is closed.

### Return Value

The only parameter is a number containing the [close code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent) send by the server.

### Example

```javascript
api.on('disconnected', (code) => {
  if (code !== 1000) {
    console.log('Connection is closed due to error.');
  } else {
    console.log('Connection is closed normally.');
  }
});
```
